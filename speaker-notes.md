## Slide 7: When AI Attacks - The $25.3M Wake-Up Call (90 seconds)

**Dramatic Opening:**
"February 2024, Hong Kong. A finance worker receives a video call from his company's CFO requesting an urgent, confidential transaction. The CFO looks real, sounds real, and is joined by other familiar colleagues. The worker transfers $25.3 million. Every person on that call was fake."

**The Attack Breakdown:**
"Here's how sophisticated this was:
1. **Reconnaissance Phase**: Criminals didn't hack anything. They used publicly available content - company websites, LinkedIn videos, earnings calls, conference presentations. All the material they needed was freely available online.

2. **Deepfake Creation**: Using AI tools that cost less than $50/month, they created convincing video calls with multiple executives. The technology is democratized - anyone can do this now.

3. **Social Engineering**: They created urgency, confidentiality, and authority - the perfect storm for decision-making under pressure.

4. **Execution**: In one call, $25.3 million vanished. The employee had no reason to doubt what he was seeing and hearing."

**The Bigger Picture:**
- **1,700% increase in deepfake fraud since 2022** - Sumsub's Identity Fraud Report shows this isn't isolated
- **$12.3 billion in global AI-enabled fraud losses in 2023** - Cybersecurity Ventures
- **96% of deepfake videos are non-consensual** - Mostly targeting women, but increasingly targeting executives

**Physical Security Implications:**
"This isn't just about financial fraud:
- **Identity Verification**: Visual confirmation is no longer sufficient. If you can't trust a video call with your CEO, how do you trust facial recognition for building access?
- **Access Control**: Facial recognition systems become vulnerable to spoofing attacks
- **Executive Protection**: High-value targets like CEOs, government officials, military leaders face unprecedented impersonation risks"

**Tampa Bay Reality Check:**
"Think about MacDill AFB - CENTCOM and SOCOM headquarters. Imagine a deepfake video of a general ordering facility access or operational changes. The implications are staggering."

**Transition:** "But here's the good news - AI can also be our strongest defense against AI attacks."

## Slide 8: AI as Your Security Force Multiplier (90 seconds)

**Empowering Opening:**
"AI doesn't replace security professionals - it makes each one of you exponentially more effective. Think of it as giving every security officer superhuman capabilities."

**Intelligent Surveillance Revolution:**
"Traditional surveillance requires human eyes on screens. AI surveillance is like having a tireless analyst watching every camera:
- **Real-time Object Detection**: 99.5% accuracy in identifying weapons, suspicious packages, unauthorized vehicles. That's better than human accuracy under stress.
- **Behavioral Analytics**: AI learns what normal looks like in your facility. Someone loitering, unusual crowd formations, aggressive behavior - detected 85% faster than human observation.
- **Facial Recognition**: Sub-second identification against watchlists, but with liveness detection to prevent deepfake spoofing."

**Smart Access Control:**
"Multi-modal biometric authentication - face, iris, fingerprint combined - achieves 99.99% accuracy. But here's the key: adaptive permissions based on context. The system knows if someone's trying to access a server room at 2 AM on a Sunday - that's unusual and requires additional verification."

**Predictive Security:**
"This is where AI truly shines:
- **Threat Prediction**: 70% of security incidents can be prevented by analyzing patterns. AI spots the precursors humans miss.
- **Anomaly Detection**: 24/7 monitoring that never gets tired, never gets distracted, never takes a break.
- **Risk Assessment**: Dynamic threat scoring that allocates resources where they're needed most, reducing costs by 40%."

**Proven ROI:**
"The numbers don't lie:
- **3.2x return on investment** within 18 months
- **87% faster response times** from incident detection to action
- **50% staff efficiency gain** - security professionals focus on high-value activities instead of routine monitoring"

**Tampa Bay Success Story:**
"Port Tampa Bay implemented AI container scanning last year. 43% reduction in security incidents, 24/7 automated monitoring, and the system paid for itself in 8 months through prevented theft and improved efficiency."

**Transition:** "Now let's bring this home to Tampa Bay - what specific threats are we facing, and how is AI helping us respond?"
