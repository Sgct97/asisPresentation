# PRESENTATION DESIGN RULES - MANDATORY COMPLIANCE
# These rules are based on actual mistakes made and MUST be followed

presentation_rules:
  
  # CRITICAL SPACE UTILIZATION RULES
  space_usage:
    - ALWAYS use the full available screen space (100vh height, full width)
    - NEVER make elements tiny and centered with empty space around them
    - NEVER create layouts that waste 50%+ of the available space
    - USE grid layouts or flexbox to distribute content across the entire viewport
    - SCALE elements UP to fill space, not DOWN to create wasted space
    - Minimum font sizes: headers 24px+, body text 16px+, small text 12px+
    - Elements should span multiple columns/rows when appropriate

  # VIEWPORT FITTING RULES  
  viewport_compliance:
    - ALL content MUST fit within 100vh without scrolling
    - NEVER create elements that extend beyond the viewport boundaries
    - Test element sizes: if total content height > 100vh, reduce padding/margins/font sizes
    - Use overflow: hidden and test all content visibility
    - Grid/flex containers must have proper height constraints
    - NEVER use min-height without max-height constraints

  # CONTENT REMOVAL PROTOCOL
  content_management:
    - BEFORE removing ANY content from slides, ALWAYS update speaker-notes.md first
    - Include ALL removed details, examples, statistics, and explanations in speaker notes
    - Add visual cues in speaker notes ("Point to left section", "Reference slide visual")
    - NEVER delete information without preserving it for the speaker
    - Maintain technical depth in notes even when simplifying slide visuals

  # DESIGN TRANSFORMATION RULES
  visual_redesign:
    - When transforming slides, create COHESIVE layouts, not scattered elements
    - Use grid systems to create unified, flowing designs
    - NEVER just remove content - redesign the entire layout structure
    - Elements should relate to each other visually and spatially
    - Maintain premium aesthetic while ensuring functionality

  # INTERPRETATION RULES
  user_requests:
    - "Make the next 5 slides" means ADD slides 9-13, NOT replace existing slides 5-8
    - "Fix spacing" means adjust the specific problematic elements, NOT redesign everything
    - "Use all the space" means expand elements to fill viewport, NOT shrink them
    - "Make it readable" means increase font sizes appropriately, NOT distort layouts
    - When user shows screenshots of problems, address ONLY those specific issues

  # ITERATIVE FIXING RULES
  problem_solving:
    - NEVER make changes that affect elements not mentioned in the user's complaint
    - When fixing cutoff issues: reduce padding/margins incrementally (2-5px at a time)
    - When fixing font size issues: increase in small increments (1-2px at a time)  
    - STOP after addressing the specific problem - don't "improve" other areas
    - If a fix doesn't work after 2 attempts, try a different approach entirely

  # CSS DEBUGGING RULES
  technical_fixes:
    - For cutoff content: first check padding/margins, then font sizes, then container heights
    - NEVER increase element sizes when they already don't fit
    - Use flexbox justify-content and align-items for proper distribution
    - Test grid template areas to ensure proper element placement
    - Remove min-height constraints that force content overflow

  # FEATURE DEVELOPMENT RULES
  functionality:
    - If a feature (like click-to-enlarge) doesn't work after 3 attempts, REMOVE it completely
    - Don't spend endless time debugging broken features
    - Focus on core presentation functionality over advanced interactions
    - JavaScript event listeners often fail - test thoroughly or avoid complex interactions

  # QUALITY CONTROL RULES
  final_checks:
    - EVERY slide change must be tested for viewport compliance
    - EVERY content removal must have corresponding speaker note updates
    - EVERY redesign must use available space effectively
    - EVERY fix must address the specific problem without creating new ones

# FORBIDDEN ACTIONS - NEVER DO THESE
never_do:
  - Make elements small and center them with empty space around
  - Remove content without updating speaker notes
  - Create layouts where content extends beyond viewport
  - Fix one element by breaking five others
  - Spend more than 3 attempts on the same broken feature
  - Interpret "next slides" as "replace existing slides"
  - Make changes to elements not mentioned in user feedback
  - Increase element sizes when they already don't fit
  - Create scattered, unrelated design elements instead of cohesive layouts

# MANDATORY WORKFLOW
workflow:
  1. READ user request carefully - identify specific elements/issues mentioned
  2. CHECK if content removal is involved - update speaker notes FIRST if so
  3. ASSESS available space - design to use full viewport effectively  
  4. MAKE targeted changes only to mentioned elements
  5. TEST viewport compliance before submitting
  6. VERIFY speaker notes contain all necessary detail for removed content

# SUCCESS CRITERIA
success_metrics:
  - All content fits within 100vh viewport
  - No wasted empty space (elements use 80%+ of available area)
  - Speaker notes contain comprehensive details for simplified slides
  - User can give presentation without reading slide content
  - Premium aesthetic maintained while being functional
  - Specific user complaints addressed without creating new problems
